      <p>
        I am a career-change full-stack developer, currently employed in a junior position. I recently completed a software development apprenticeship with distinction. My contributions and fresh perspective were recognised when I was shortlisted in the Rising Star category at the Makers Awards 2025, where I proudly showcased my employer alongside industry leaders such as Apple and the DWP. I am now navigating the tech world by combining my technical expertise with a rich palette of transferable skills gained over 11 years in the hospitality industry.
